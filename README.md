## A general support/utility library in C.

Not all modules have been implemented.

The most interesting bits are probably the random number generator (Mersenne Twister with the revised seeding procedure); the skiplist (using a paged, deterministic algorithm); the wavelet-based, k-means clustering code; and maybe the graph dfs and perfect hash generator.

Actual documentation to come some day soon.
